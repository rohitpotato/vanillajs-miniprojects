# Vanillajs-miniprojects
## Few mini projects i have built to practice my vanilla js skills.

1. ### Chuck Norris joke Generator: 
    As simple as it sounds, uses the [chucknorris api](http://www.icndb.com/api/) to fetch some random jokes based on user specifying the 
    number they want.
    
2. ### Easy-http:
    A http library built with xhr combined with promises. Nothing too complicated!

3. ### Todo-App:
    A simple todo application combined with local storage to store data.
